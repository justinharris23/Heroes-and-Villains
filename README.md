## Post-MVP Ideas

- Add a customer cursor
- Add a More Characters area
- Make the More Characters buttons and have them clickable
- Make a button to change the background image
- Create a full on dark mode that changes more elements of the css
- Pull in a quote from each character, the API, had this setup differently than the main character one, so we'd have to connect them somehow
- Make the images do more when hover over them
- Pull in a tv show clips from another API
- Intro animation with Breaking Bad sounds/audio
