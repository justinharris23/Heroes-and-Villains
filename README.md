## Post-MVP Ideas
- Add a dark mode feature
- Use object oriented programming to create reusable elements
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file.

## Other-MVP Ideas
- Have the characters/cards battle, so this becomes more of a game called Heroes vs Villains
- For Heroes vs Villains, the user would search two characters to battle. 
- Two cards would get displayed side by side and there would be a Battle button
- Clicking the Battle button would allow compare each characters "Power" stat
- The charater with the highest "Power" would be declared the winner
